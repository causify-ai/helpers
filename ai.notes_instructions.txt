# Principles for Note-Optimized Text

## Goals and Philosophy

1) Make the text easy to consume for both humans and AI

2) Focus on:
  - Clarity
  - Brevity
  - Visual structure

- Think of the notes as a hybrid between a textbook and a student’s notebook

- This document is written using the rules described in itself

## Formatting Guidelines

* Headers and Paragraphs
- Use headers and paragraphs
  ```
  # Header 1

  ## Header 2
  ```

- A paragraph starts with `*`
  ```
  * Paragraph
  - Bullet 1
    - Sub-bullet 1.1
    - Sub-bullet 1.2
      - Sub-bullet 1.2.1
    ...
  ```

- Use title case for section and paragraph headers
  - **Good**: Use Only Text
  - **Bad**: Use only text

* Use Only Text
- Avoid emojis and icons
- Avoid any decorative formatting
  - **Bad**: a line separator like `---`
- Use only basic text
  - **Good**: -> "
  - **Bad**: → “ ” 

* Use Bullets
- Use bullet points inside a paragraph

- Each bullet should express one complete atomic idea
  - Keep bullets concise but meaningful (1–3 lines)

- Use bullets to show:
  - Definitions
  - Purpose
  - Components
  - Pros and cons
  - Examples

- Use `=` for definitions
  - Example:
    ```
    - Latency = the delay before a transfer of data begins after an instruction
    ```

- Group bullets under clear paragraph headings

* Use Nested Bullets
- Use nested bullets to show:
  - Dependencies and relationships
    - E.g., cause -> effect
  - Hierarchy of concepts, e.g.,
    ```
    - Technology
      - Hardware
        - Computers
        - Mobile Devices
      - Software
        - Operating Systems
        - Applications
    ```
  - Components and lists, e.g.,
    ```
    - Allowed formats:
      - Graphviz
      - Mermaid
      - TikZ-style charts
    ```
  - Elaboration, not to extend main bullets, e.g., for
    - Definitions
    - Examples
    - Implications

## Writing Style

* Writing Style
- Use explicit references
  - **Good**: "TCP protocol"
  - **Bad**: "it"

- Maintain consistent labels for recurring ideas

- Avoid redundancy in concepts

- Prefer plain language over academic jargon

* Avoid long prose
- Prefer structured notes over narrative prose

- Use a first-person, self-directed voice
  - **Good**: "Key thing to remember: entropy increases"

* Use direct statements
- Convert abstract principles into short, direct statements
  - **Bad**: "Everyone takes responsibility, owns their projects, and blames no one
    if something doesn't get finished."
  - **Good**: "Everyone takes responsibility: no blaming others if work isn't
    finished."

* Use Diagrams Over Text When Possible
- Summarize systems or relationships using:
  - Graphviz
  - Mermaid
  - Tikz-style charts
- Add annotation arrows and layered explanations

  ## QUESTION 1: WHAT ARE YOUR CORE VALUES?

  Core Values are a timeless set of guiding principles. There are
  typically just a few—3 to 7 is the rule of thumb. They define the
  behaviors you expect from each other. They define your culture and who
  fits and who doesn’t. They define what makes your company different and
  unique.

  A famous business guru, Peter Drucker, is attributed with the saying,
  "Culture eats strategy for breakfast." History has shown that culture
  wins in the long run, not strategy. For a company to be great, it must
  first know who it is. Then focus on strategy. Who you are as a company
  is defined by your Core Values.

  Every company has different Core Values because, well, every company is
  different. To help build a strong culture, your company will use your
  Core Values to hire, fire, and review everyone (how this happens will be
  detailed in [Chapter 8](#Top_of_Chapter08_html)).

  Here is an example of the EOS Worldwide Core Values (keep in mind yours
  will be different):

  **1.**Humbly Confident

  **2.**Grow or Die

  **3.**Help First

  **4.**Do What You Say

  **5.**Do the Right Thing

  Let’s take one of those, "Do What You Say," as an example. In a "Do What
  You Say" culture, everyone delivers on time. That means if you commit to
  a date, you hit it. You fully deliver and finish what you start—doing
  things half-assed or half-finished is unacceptable. Everyone takes
  responsibility, owns their projects, and blames no one if something
  doesn’t get finished. Finally, in a "Do What You Say" culture, it is
  okay to say no—if you can’t do it, don’t commit.

  Your leadership team has worked very hard to discover what your
  company’s Core Values are in order to build an amazing culture. Once
  these Values are shared, we urge you to ask questions in order to fully
  understand them. Ultimately you have to ask yourself, "Do I share these
  Core Values?"

  You’ll find that when you work with people who share the same Core
  Values, communication is easier, things get done faster, and the work
  environment is more fun. You will have a great organization and a strong
  culture.
  ```

- The output should be:
  ```
  * Core values
  - Are a timeless set of guiding principles
  - Define the culture, who fits and who doesn't
  - Define what makes the Company different and unique

  * Culture > strategy
  - In a Company, culture wins in the long term
  - A Company
    - Needs to know who it is
    - Is defined by the Core Values

  * Uses of Core Values
  - Hire
  - Fire
  - Review everyone

  * Core values: EOS Worldwide example
  - Be humble but confident
  - Grow or die
  - Help first
  - Do what you say
    - E.g., if you commit to a date, you hit it
    - You fully deliver and finish what you start: no half-assed things
    - If you can't do it, don't commit
  - Do the right thing
  ```
