* Data Science
- **Promises of data science** (DS)
  - Give a competitive advantages
  - Make better strategic and tactical business decisions
  - Optimize business processes
- **Data science is not new**, it was called:
  - Operation research (~1970-80s)
  - Decision support, Business intelligence (~1990s)
  - Predictive analytics (Early 2010s)
- ...
- **What has changed**
  - Now learning and applying DS is **easy**
    - No need for hiring a consulting company
  - Tools are open-source
    - E.g., Python + pydata stack (numpy, scipy, Pandas, sklearn)
  - Large data sets available
  - Cheap computing (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud)

* Motivation: Data Overload
- **"Data science is the number one catalyst for economic growth**"
  - McKinsey, 2013
- **Explosion of data in every domain**
  - Sensing devices/networks monitor processes 24/7
    - E.g., temperature of your room, your vital signs, pollution in the air
  - Sophisticated smart-phones (80% of the world population)
  - Internet and social networks make it easy to publish data
  - Internet of Things (IoT): everything is connected to the internet
    - E.g., power supply, toasters
  - Datafication: turn all aspects of life into data
    - E.g., what you like/enjoy turned into a stream of your "likes"
- **Challenges**
  - How to handle the increasing amount data?
  - How to extract actionable insights and scientific knowledge from data?

* Scale of Data Size
- **Megabyte** = 210 approx 106 bytes
  - Typical English book
- **Gigabyte** = 109 bytes = 1000 MB
  - 1/2 hour of video
  - Wikipedia (compressed, without media) is 22GB
- **Terabyte** = 1M MB
  - Human genome: ~1TB
  - 100,000 photos
  - LHC generates 100TB of data per day
  - 50 to buy 1TB HDD, 23/mo on AWS S3
- **Petabyte** = 1000 TB
  - 13 years of HD video
  - 250k (USD) /year on AWS S3
- **Exabyte** = 1M TB
  - Global yearly Internet traffic in 2004
- **Zetabyte** = 1B TB = 1021 bytes
  - Global yearly Internet traffic in 2016
- **Yottabytes** = 1024 bytes
  - Yottabyte costs (USD) 100T
- **Brontobytes** = 1027 bytes
