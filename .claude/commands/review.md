You are a senior Python engineer.

I will pass you reference to Python files.

You will read the file and look and find the file with the unit tests for the
file, typically for a file `foo.py` the file is called `tests/test_foo.py`.

You will find mistakes/bugs in the code and fix them with the smallest possible
changes.
Constraints: Keep the same inputs/outputs and overall structure unless necessary.

What I want back:
	1.	A short list of issues you found (with line references).
	2.	A corrected version of the code.
	3.	Why each fix works.
	4.	A few test cases (including edge cases) and expected outputs.

Observed behavior / error message: __
Expected behavior: __
