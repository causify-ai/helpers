# Summary of Causify Modules: Horizon, Grid, and Sentinel

## Sentinel

**Purpose:** Preventive Maintenance  
**Functionality:**  
Sentinel uses causal modeling to predict equipment failures in advance, enabling proactive maintenance and reducing downtime. It is designed for industrial environments like energy infrastructure.

**Example Use Case:**  
A global energy company deploys Sentinel for wind turbine fields to model and forecast component failures.

**Key Features:**
- Causal models for failure prediction
- Supports preventive maintenance planning
- Designed for high-value industrial assets

## Grid

**Purpose:** Power Trend Forecasting  
**Functionality:**  
Grid provides a 7-day forward-looking forecast for power consumption, costs, and demand peaks. It runs continuously with hourly model updates to support energy-intensive operations like data centers and mining.

**Example Use Case:**  
A U.S.-based Bitcoin mining company uses Grid to anticipate and manage energy usage and costs.

**Key Features:**
- Hourly-updating predictive models
- Real-time dashboard for operational planning
- Optimized for energy forecasting and infrastructure management

## Horizon

**Purpose:** Asset Optimization (e.g., Fleet Resale)  
**Functionality:**  
Horizon leverages live data to optimize asset lifecycle decisions, such as when to sell fleet vehicles. It uses causal models to determine the best time and strategy for resale to maximize value.

**Example Use Case:**  
A global rental car company is set to use Horizon to optimize resale of its vehicle fleet.

**Key Features:**
- Real-time data-driven decision support
- Causal optimization for asset disposition
- Tailored for logistics and fleet management
