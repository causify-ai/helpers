## Introduction and motivation

- What is tool about?
- What problem or limitation does this tool solve?
- Who needs to understand this tool?

## Core Concepts

- List and explain key ideas, building blocks, or theoretical foundations.
  - **Concept 1:** Brief explanation
  - **Concept 2:** How it relates to others
  - **Concept 3:** Dependencies or assumptions
- Attach diagrams or charts (e.g., using Graphviz dot, Mermaid, Tikz) whenever
  possible or necessary.

## How It Works

- Describe in detail the internal process, architecture and/or flow.
  - Step-by-step or component-based explanation
  - Show key data transformations or control flow
  - Include diagrams or pseudocode if helpful
    ```markfown
    [Component A] → transforms → [Component B] → outputs → [Result]
    ```
