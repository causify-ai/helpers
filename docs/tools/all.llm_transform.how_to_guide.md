I'll analyze the structure of these three files and explain how they work together. Let me break this down systematically.

1. First, let me search for relevant code to understand the structure better.

Based on the code analysis, I can explain the structure of these three files and how they work together. Here's a comprehensive breakdown:

1. **Overall Architecture**
The system is designed to apply LLM-based transformations to code and text files, with a focus on code quality, documentation, and formatting. The architecture consists of three main components:

2. **llm_transform.py** (Main Entry Point)
- This is the primary script that users interact with
- Key features:
  - Handles input/output from either stdin/stdout or files
  - Manages Docker container setup and execution
  - Provides command-line interface for various transformations
- Main functions:
  - `_parse()`: Sets up command-line argument parsing
  - `_run_dockerized_llm_transform()`: Manages Docker container execution
  - `_main()`: Orchestrates the overall transformation process

3. **dockerized_llm_transform.py** (Docker Container Script)
- Runs inside a Docker container
- Key features:
  - Handles the actual LLM transformation
  - Manages dependencies within the container
  - Processes input/output files
- Main functions:
  - `_parse()`: Parses command-line arguments
  - `_main()`: Executes the transformation using LLM prompts

4. **llm_prompts.py** (Prompt Management)
- Contains all the transformation prompts and their configurations
- Key features:
  - Defines various transformation types (code fixes, reviews, markdown processing)
  - Manages pre and post-transformation steps
  - Handles prompt templates and contexts
- Main components:
  - Prompt definitions (e.g., `code_fix_docstrings`, `code_review_correctness`)
  - Transformation management (`run_prompt()`)
  - Context definitions (`_CODING_CONTEXT`, `_MD_CONTEXT`)

5. **Transformation Types**
The system supports several categories of transformations:
- Code Fixes:
  - Docstring improvements
  - Type hint additions
  - Logging statement fixes
  - String formatting fixes
- Code Reviews:
  - Correctness review
  - Refactoring suggestions
- Markdown Processing:
  - Document rewriting
  - Summarization
  - How-to guide formatting
  - Explanation document formatting

6. **Transformation Process Flow**
1. User calls `llm_transform.py` with input/output files and transformation type
2. `llm_transform.py` sets up Docker container and passes control to `dockerized_llm_transform.py`
3. `dockerized_llm_transform.py` uses `llm_prompts.py` to:
   - Apply pre-transformations
   - Execute LLM transformation
   - Apply post-transformations
4. Results are written back to the output file

7. **Docker Integration**
- Uses Python 3.12 Alpine as base image
- Installs necessary dependencies (PyYAML, requests, pandas, openai)
- Manages file paths between host and container
- Handles environment variables (e.g., OPENAI_API_KEY)

8. **Error Handling and Logging**
- Comprehensive logging system
- Type checking and assertions
- Error handling for file operations
- Docker container management error handling

This architecture provides a robust and flexible system for applying LLM-based transformations to code and text files, with proper isolation of dependencies through Docker and a clear separation of concerns between the different components.
