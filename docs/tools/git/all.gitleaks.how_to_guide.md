# Gitleaks How to Guide

## How to run Gitleaks locally

The easiest way to run Gitleaks locally is with Docker

- First, pull the image:

  ```bash
  > docker pull zricethezav/gitleaks:latest
  ```

- Scan git repositories for secrets (including git history)

  ```bash
  > docker run -v $(pwd):/path zricethezav/gitleaks:latest git /path -v -c /path/.github/gitleaks-rules.toml
      ○
      │╲
      │ ○
      ○ ░
      ░    gitleaks

  7:52PM INF 1540 commits scanned.
  7:52PM INF scanned ~51542901 bytes (51.54 MB) in 46.4s
  7:52PM INF no leaks found
  ```

- Scan directories or files for secrets

  ```bash
  > docker run -v $(pwd):/path zricethezav/gitleaks:latest dir /path -v -c /path/.github/gitleaks-rules.toml
      ○
      │╲
      │ ○
      ○ ░
      ░    gitleaks

  8:00PM INF scanned ~23901530 bytes (23.90 MB) in 26.1s
  8:00PM INF no leaks found
  ```

## How to deal with false positives

- Some secrets are detected by Gitleaks that are not actually secrets but false
  positives
- To deal with false positives, we can use the following methods:

1. Use inline comments to allow specific lines of code

```bash
> aws_access_key_id=*** # gitleaks:allow
```

2. Add the fingerprint to the `.gitleaksignore` file

```bash
> cat .gitleaksignore
> ck.infra/infra/terraform/environments/preprod/ap-northeast-1/terraform.tfvars:rule3:429
> 93f292c3dfa2649ef91f8925b623e79546fa992e:README.md:aws-access-token:121
```

3. Adjust the `allowlists` or `rules` in the `gitleaks-rules.toml` file to
   reduce false positives

```bash
> cat .github/gitleaks-rules.toml
title = "gitleaks config"

[[allowlists]]
description = "global allow lists"
paths = [
    # Gitleaks rules file.
    '''(^|.*/)gitleaks-rules\.toml$''',
    # Compressed files.
    '''.*\.(csv|txt)\.gz$''',
    # Zip files.
    '''.*\.zip$''',
    # Gitleaks ignore file.
    '''.gitleaksignore$''',
]
...
[[rules]]
    id = "rule2"
    description = '''AWS API Key'''
    regex = '''AKIA[0-9A-Z]{16}'''
    tags = ["secret"]
```

## How to remove leaks from previous commits in PR

- When leaks are committed to a PR, they remain in the commit history even after
  removal
- The Gitleaks GitHub Actions will fail due to these leaks in the commit history
- We can remove leaks from the commit history using the following methods:

- Option 1: Soft reset and combine all commits in the PR into a single commit
  - Use this method if you want to discard all commit history in the PR

  ```bash
  # Checkout the PR branch
  > git checkout <PR-branch-name>

  # Reset to the base commit but keep changes staged
  > git reset --soft $(git merge-base HEAD master)

  # Create a new commit with all changes
  > git commit -m "<commit-message>"

  # Force push to the remote branch
  > git push -f
  ```

- Option 2: Rebase and squash only the commits that contain the leaks
  - Use this method if you want to retain some commit history in the PR
  - See [this guide](https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/git-squash-commits) for
    more details on how to rebase and squash commits
