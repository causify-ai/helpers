- There is often overlap between:
  - Internal white papers (aka an internal report)
  - Journal / conference papers
  - Blogs
  - Internal documentation
  - Research Google Docs

- The invariants are:
  - The internal documentation contains all the information at maximum level of
    details using Diataxis as a framework
  - An internal white paper contains an "abstract view" of our internal
    documentation focusing more on architecture and high-level results
  - A journal / conference paper is a succinct version of an internal white paper
  - A blog is often the union of several pieces of documentation
  - Often a project starts a blog and then evolves into a journal / conference article
  - Research Google Docs are internal ways of on-going storing information for
    our projects
