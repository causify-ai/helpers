## Takeaways

### Core Needs

1.  Automated Code Review vs. Code Generation
    - **GitHub Copilot** is primarily an AI-assisted code generation tool
      (though it also has a "Code Review" beta). Its strength lies in offering
      real-time suggestions as you code.
    - **Graphite** is focused on PR workflow optimization and automated checks,
      helping streamline how pull requests are created, reviewed, and merged.
    - **Coderabbit** is geared toward AI-based code review and analysis, aiming
      to provide feedback on potential bugs, performance issues, and style
      concerns.

2.  Integration with GitHub
    - **Copilot** integrates directly within GitHub (especially if you're using
      GitHub for everything).
    - **Graphite** integrates well with GitHub but provides its own dashboard
      and workflow enhancements. **Coderabbit** is newer but also targets GitHub
      integration. You'll want to verify how mature their integration is and
      whether it fits your team's workflows.

3.  Budget & Licensing
    - **GitHub Copilot** is priced per user per month. For 30â€“40 developers, the
      cost scales linearly.
    - **Graphite** and **Coderabbit** typically use a per-seat or tiered pricing
      model as well.
    - If you already have a GitHub Enterprise or Team plan, adding Copilot can
      be straightforward. Graphite and Coderabbit would be additional monthly
      expenses.

### Strengths and Weaknesses

#### Github Copilot

- Strengths
  - Seamless integration if your team is already deeply invested in GitHub.
  - Great for boosting productivity during coding (boilerplate, tests,
    refactors).
  - Provides a familiar in-IDE experience.

- Weaknesses
  - The "Copilot for Code Review" feature is relatively new and may not offer
    deep analysis compared to specialized tools.
  - Can produce "best guess" suggestions that require human oversight.

#### Graphite.dev

- Strengths
  - Focuses on improving the pull request workflow, making it faster and more
    organized.
  - Catches common style or lint issues early, reducing manual review overhead.
  - Ideal for teams seeking to structure their PR process rigorously (e.g.,
    stacked diffs, streamlined merges).

- Weaknesses
  - Not as advanced in AI-based code analysis as some specialized code-review
    tools.
  - May require your team to adapt to a new PR workflow or dashboard.

#### CodeRabbit

- Strengths
  - Billed as an AI-driven code review tool, aiming for deeper analysis of
    logic, bugs, and potential improvements.
  - If effective, it could reduce the time spent on finding edge cases or hidden
    issues.

- Weaknesses
  - A relatively new entrant; maturity and coverage (languages, frameworks) need
    to be confirmed.
  - Integration details might not be as polished or comprehensive yet.
