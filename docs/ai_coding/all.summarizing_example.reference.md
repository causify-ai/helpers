  ## QUESTION 1: WHAT ARE YOUR CORE VALUES?

  Core Values are a timeless set of guiding principles. There are
  typically just a few—3 to 7 is the rule of thumb. They define the
  behaviors you expect from each other. They define your culture and who
  fits and who doesn’t. They define what makes your company different and
  unique.

  A famous business guru, Peter Drucker, is attributed with the saying,
  "Culture eats strategy for breakfast." History has shown that culture
  wins in the long run, not strategy. For a company to be great, it must
  first know who it is. Then focus on strategy. Who you are as a company
  is defined by your Core Values.

  Every company has different Core Values because, well, every company is
  different. To help build a strong culture, your company will use your
  Core Values to hire, fire, and review everyone (how this happens will be
  detailed in [Chapter 8](#Top_of_Chapter08_html)).

  Here is an example of the EOS Worldwide Core Values (keep in mind yours
  will be different):

  **1.**Humbly Confident

  **2.**Grow or Die

  **3.**Help First

  **4.**Do What You Say

  **5.**Do the Right Thing

  Let’s take one of those, "Do What You Say," as an example. In a "Do What
  You Say" culture, everyone delivers on time. That means if you commit to
  a date, you hit it. You fully deliver and finish what you start—doing
  things half-assed or half-finished is unacceptable. Everyone takes
  responsibility, owns their projects, and blames no one if something
  doesn’t get finished. Finally, in a "Do What You Say" culture, it is
  okay to say no—if you can’t do it, don’t commit.

  Your leadership team has worked very hard to discover what your
  company’s Core Values are in order to build an amazing culture. Once
  these Values are shared, we urge you to ask questions in order to fully
  understand them. Ultimately you have to ask yourself, "Do I share these
  Core Values?"

  You’ll find that when you work with people who share the same Core
  Values, communication is easier, things get done faster, and the work
  environment is more fun. You will have a great organization and a strong
  culture.
