# Tutorial: How to Create a Claude Artifact

## 1. Open a Claude Chat
Start a new conversation in Claude. Ensure you are using a version that supports Artifacts.

## 2. Enter a Prompt for an Artifact
Type a request that involves generating something interactive or persistent.  
Examples:
- Create a webpage that displays a counter
- Generate a Python script that visualizes data
- Build a simple todo app UI

Claude detects that your output is suitable for an Artifact.

## 3. Accept the Artifact Suggestion
Claude will show a prompt offering to turn the output into an Artifact.  
Select the option to open it as an Artifact.

## 4. Edit the Artifact
Inside the Artifact panel, you can:
- Modify files
- Add new files
- Switch between preview and code
- Test the functionality live

Changes are saved automatically.

## 5. Iterate Through Chat
Ask Claude to update the Artifact. Claude will modify the relevant files without replacing the whole project.

## 6. Export or Share
When finished, you can download the Artifact files or share them according to the platform options available.

This is the basic workflow for creating and iterating on a Claude Artifact.
