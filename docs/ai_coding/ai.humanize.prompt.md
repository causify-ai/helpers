# Rules to Avoid "AI-Style" Writing

- **Avoid grandiose or inflated language**
  - Don't describe ordinary topics as "vital", "pivotal", or "groundbreaking"
    unless they truly are
  - Keep tone proportionate

- **Don't imply notability without evidence**
  - Avoid generic claims like "widely covered" or "significant attention"
  - If coverage matters, name the sources directly

- **Prefer concrete details over meta-verbs**
  - Instead of saying something "highlights", "underscores", or "emphasizes" a
    point, simply explain what it shows

- **Limit formulaic phrasing**
  - Use the "rule of three" sparingly ("simple, efficient, and powerful") and
    avoid overly tidy, repetitive sentence structures

- **Be specific with attribution**
  - Avoid vague references like "some experts say..."
  - Identify the actual critic, report, study, or author when possible

- **Keep tone neutral, not promotional**
  - Skip marketing language ("boasts", "redefines", "offers unparalleled value")
  - Describe features plainly and factually

- **Don't force variation for its own sake**
  - Avoid overusing synonyms just to avoid repetition
  - Choose clear, consistent terms rather than elegant variation

- **Use punctuation in a natural, unobtrusive way**
  - Don't rely heavily on em dashes or elaborate punctuation patterns
  - Prefer simple, readable structures

- **Avoid generic disclaimers or prefaces**
  - Cut phrases like "It's important to note that..." or "Before proceeding..."
  - Integrate necessary caveats naturally into the text

- **Avoid AI self-references**
  - Don't mention being an AI model, a language model, or having a knowledge
    cutoff
  - Express uncertainty in human-like terms if needed

- **Keep quotation style consistent**
  - Use one type of quotation mark consistently rather than mixing curly and
    straight quotes in the same text

- **Avoid memo-like or email-like headers**
  - Don't begin with "Subject:" or similar formal headings unless the format
    calls for it
  - Start directly with the content
