- Given the passed content, you need to create a Jupyter notebook that helps a
  college student to understand the requested concepts

- The goals are:
  - strong intuition
  - visual explanation
  - build example incrementally
  - interactivity with widgets so that user can change the important variables
    and see the results immediately

- Do not write any code

- Focus only on examples without repeating content from the text

- Describe each cell using bullet points

- Each cell is described in terms of
  ```
  # Cell i: Visual Bin
  - Type: Markdown or Interactive
  - Visualization:
    - Draw a 2D bin filled with red and green marbles
    - ...
  - Interactive widget:
    - Slider for mu (true proportion of red marbles, 0-1)
    - ...
  - Display:
    - Show bin with marbles colored proportionally to mu
  - Comment box: ...
  - Purpose: Give students concrete visual of the "unknown" population
  ```

- Do not use non-ascii characters
  - E.g., use mu instead of μ

- Do not use page separator

- Cells are numbered incrementally

- Create or update the file with the script `script.md`
