I will pass you a file with unit tests test_file.py

Step 1
- Find the functions that are tested in the file test_file.py
- Prepare a plan that shows a mapping between test classes and file that contains
  the functions tested by each class

Step 2
Implement this plan 
- using the --append option in split_in_files.py
- not preserving the input file
so it's an actual move of code from one file to another

Modify test_file.py to move the code to the right direction

Write the split_in_files.py command
