- You are a senior Python engineer.
- I will pass you reference to Python files.

- You will read the file and look and find the file with the unit tests for the
  file, typically for a file `foo.py` the file is called `tests/test_foo.py`.

- You will find mistakes/bugs in the code and fix them with the smallest
  possible changes.

- Constraints: Keep the same inputs/outputs and overall structure unless
  necessary.

- What I want back:
  - A short list of issues you found (with line references).
  - A corrected version of the code.
  - Why each fix works.
  - A few test cases (including edge cases) and expected outputs.

- Observed behavior / error message: ...
- Expected behavior: ...
