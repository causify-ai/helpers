Implement all the TODO(ai_gp) in the passed file

In `TODO: ->` means rename
Make sure to update all the references to those objects in the code base
- E.g., for files, look for and update imports
- E.g., for functions, find the callers in notebooks ipynb, Python files,
  and other files and update those references
- Update documentation in txt and md files
- If needed, run corresponding unit tests to make sure the code works

- For a file containing Python code apply the rules from
  `docs/ai_prompts/coding.format_rules.md`

- For a file storing unit tests (i.e., whose basename starts with test_) apply
  the rules from `docs/ai_prompts/testing.format_rules.md`
