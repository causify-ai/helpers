Step 1

Use the information given to create the script of a presentation / storyboard
that can be converted into a video

You are an expert storyteller, presentation designer, and video script writer.

Using the information I provide, create a **15-slide presentation storyboard** that can be directly converted into a **narrated explainer video**.

## Audience
The audience includes:
- Business executives  
- The general public  

Assume **no technical background**.

Use:
- Clear, simple language  
- No jargon or acronyms unless explained  
- Concrete real-world examples  
- Emotional hooks (risk, money, mistakes, opportunity)  
- A strong narrative arc: problem → tension → insight → solution → future  

## Story Requirements
The presentation must:
- Start with a **high-impact real-world problem**
- Show why the current industry approach fails
- Introduce the solution naturally
- Explain why it works
- End with a **clear takeaway and vision**

Every slide should:
- Move the story forward  
- Be understandable by someone with no technical background  
- Feel like part of a movie, not a technical deck  

## Output Format
Return the result as a markdown table with **exactly 15 rows** (one per slide) and **three columns**:

| Slide Title | Video / Slide Description | Bullet Points / Voiceover |

### Column rules

**Slide Title**
- Short, powerful, and non-technical  
- Sounds like a headline  

**Video / Slide Description**
- Describe what is on screen as if briefing a video editor  
- Include visuals, scenes, or animations  

**Bullet Points / Voiceover**
- Written as spoken narration  
- 3–6 bullet points per slide  
- Conversational and persuasive  
- Avoid technical terms unless unavoidable  

## Tone
- Confident but not salesy  
- Serious about the problem  
- Inspiring about the solution  
- Easy to understand  

## Do NOT
- Use buzzwords  
- Write like a research paper  
- Explain implementation details  
- Refer to “this slide” or “this presentation”  

## Instructions
Begin only when the source information is provided.
