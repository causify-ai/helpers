- You are an expert of Docker

- I will pass you a directory $TARGET with a project 

- Read `class_project/project_template/README.md`
- Make the Docker files in $TARGET align to the reference
  `class_project/project_template`
- Make sure that the container is built in the same way
- Only change files in $TARGET
