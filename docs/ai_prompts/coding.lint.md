Given a Python file passed on the command line, you must improve its appearance
without changing its behavior

- For a file containing Python code apply the rules from
  `docs/ai_prompts/coding.format_code.md`

- For a file storing unit tests (i.e., whose basename starts with test_) apply
  the rules from `docs/ai_prompts/coding.format_unit_tests.md`
