# AI for Optimal Decision-Making: Why the Future is Causal and Probabilistic (and not LLMs)

GP Saggese, Joel Sherlock, Paul Smith

In the age of AI, every business leader hears the same message: *use data to make better decisions*. But most systems today still make brittle, black-box predictions without understanding the **why** behind the **what**. The reality? We’re still in the early innings of AI-powered decision-making, and the biggest unlocks lie ahead.

At **Causify**, we believe businesses could be **10x more efficient**—in revenue, profit, and risk reduction—by making every decision rationally, probabilistically, and causally. Here's why.

## **Businesses Live and Die by Decisions**

Every organization, from startups to Fortune 500s, makes countless decisions every day:

- **Marketing**: Which channel *causes* the most conversions?
- **Energy**: When should we produce electricity to maximize profits?
- **Maintenance**: When should we replace the main bearings in a wind turbine?
- **Healthcare**: Which treatment *leads* to recovery?
- **Finance**: Which variables actually *drive* risk and return?
- **Policy**: Which intervention will *reduce* crime?

Great decisions require reasoning under uncertainty, an area where humans struggle and most AI tools fall short.

## **Humans Are Bad at Decision-Making**

Despite our experience and intuition, we’re wired to make poor decisions in complex environments:

- **Cognitive Biases**: Confirmation bias, loss aversion, and overconfidence distort our judgment.
- **Poor Probabilistic Intuition**: We misjudge likelihoods and misunderstand expected value.
- **Emotional Interference**: Fear, greed, or internal politics often override data.
- **Evolutionary Mismatch**: Our brains evolved for tribal survival, not for reasoning with data under uncertainty.

If your team is relying on gut feel and dashboards, you're leaving massive value on the table.

## **The Case for Bayesian Decision-Making**

**Bayesian probability** is a mathematically grounded, principled framework for making optimal decisions under uncertainty.

Bayesian methods allow us to:

- Continuously update beliefs as new evidence arrives
- Quantify uncertainty with probability distributions
- Compute *expected utility*, not just best-case outcomes
- Combine domain knowledge with data
- Build transparent and rational decision-making systems

**Bayesian reasoning replaces guesswork with evidence-based intelligence.**

## **Why Most AI Falls Short**

Today's AI—especially Large Language Models (LLMs)—are impressive, but not built for optimal decision-making:

- No structured probability models
- No Bayesian inference or belief updates
- No counterfactual reasoning
- Can't explain *why* something happens
- Can't answer "What if we had done X instead?"

They mimic patterns, they don’t reason. For high-stakes decisions in finance, energy, healthcare, and logistics—that’s not good enough.

## **Causal AI: The Next Frontier**

While traditional AI finds statistical patterns, **Causal AI** models the *underlying mechanisms* that drive results.

- **Why it matters:**
  - **Understands cause, not just correlation**
  - **Robust to change**: Still works when the world shifts (e.g., COVID, supply chain shocks)
  - **Enables planning**: Supports "What if" analysis and scenario planning
  - **Transparent**: Easier to audit, explain, and trust
  - **Efficient**: Needs less data by using structure and domain knowledge

Put simply: **Causal AI makes machines think more like scientists, not just statisticians.**

## **The Power of Time Series**

So much of business decisions depends on time:

- Energy demand
- Inventory levels
- Revenue forecasts
- Risk over time
- Customer behavior

**Time series analysis** captures these temporal dynamics and supports:

- Real-time, adaptive decision-making
- Forecasting for strategic planning
- Causal inference through time-ordered data
- Policy optimization and proactive interventions

There’s hardly a decision-making problem where time *doesn’t* matter. Causify's AI is built from the ground up to use time-series as the atom of computation.

## **Solving the Long Tail with Small Data**

Contrary to popular belief, most real-world problems are *not* big data problems.

- “Big data” (e.g., ad-tech) accounts for \~1% of business use cases.
- These problems are simple when you have billions of examples.
- The real challenge? **The 99% of “small data” problems.**

These long-tail problems are:

- Messy, complex, and noisy
- High-stakes, niche, or domain-specific
- Impossible to solve with one-size-fits-all tools
- Too costly for bespoke consulting solutions

That’s where **Causify** comes in.

## **Causify: Scalable Solutions for the Long Tail**

We’ve built a system that delivers **scalable, cost-effective AI for decision-making**—even when data is sparse or messy.

With **Bayesian \+ Causal AI**, we solve problems that were once:

- Too hard for traditional tools
- Too expensive for custom services
- Too nuanced for off-the-shelf ML models

From predicting wind turbine failures to optimizing supply chains, **we help businesses make decisions they can trust**—even in the face of uncertainty.

## **From Insight to Action**

AI shouldn't just *predict* the future. It should help you **choose the best action**, and this requires:

- Probabilistic reasoning
- Causal understanding
- Transparent models
- Domain-aware structure
- Real-time adaptation

**That’s what we’re building at Causify.**

If you’re looking to make your organization 10x smarter and more resilient, it’s time to move from black-box AI to optimal decision-making. **Let’s talk.**
